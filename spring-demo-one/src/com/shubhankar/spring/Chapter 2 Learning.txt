This chapter covers dependency injection

We shall use the example of getting a car to understand this concept. Suppose you have to order a car from the factory, maybe a tesla, then when you get the car, you do not have to
install the seats, tyres and what not. You simply drive the car, you get a fully built car. 

What we are trying to understand here is that suppose you get an object, you just want to use the object without needing to set-up it's various dependencies. This part is handled
by spring. (Car's dependencies : seats, engine, headlights and a lot of other things).

There are two ways of accomplishing using XML config,
1. Constructor injection (refer to SleepCoach to learn more about this. Both class and the xml bean)
2. Setter injection (refer to BaseballCoach to learn more, same as above)

When you use setter injection, you have to name the property with the same name as the method that is going to set the dependency. example

methodname - setBrain()
property - brain 

Likewise, we can also insert values into the properties. For that, we need to have the setter methods defined properly and we need to configure it in the XML.

Note that values can be inserted directly or through a file. Refer to the configuration to learn more.
