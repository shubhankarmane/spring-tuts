This chapter covers the scope of beans in spring

Scope means how the bean will be created, will there be only one instance or more.

By default, spring creates beans using the singleton scope. This means that the bean will be created only once and shared whenever required.

The other scopes are:

prototype - creates a new bean for every request
request   - scoped to an http web request. Only used in web apps
session   - scoped to an http web session. Only used in web apps
global-session - scoped to a global http web session. Only used in web apps
